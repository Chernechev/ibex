You can generate a printable PDF of the documentation by compiling
GoCoWiToTex.hs and executing the following commands from the main ibex
directory:

    ./gcwttx docs/manual.txt 0.3-beta12 >docs/manual.tex
    cd docs
    pdflatex manual.tex

This creates docs/manual.pdf. The automatic conversion is still a little
buggy in places, but the resulting PDF is pretty usable.

To do this, you'll need:

    * A standard LaTeX install (with all the usual packages).

    * GHC (Haskell compiler). See the comment at the top of GoCoWiToTex.hs
      for instructions on how to obtain GHC and compile GoCoWiToTex.hs.
