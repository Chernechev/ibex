Documentation at http://code.google.com/p/webspr/wiki/Documentation03

You can generate a printable PDF of the documentation by executing the
following command from the main ibex directory:

    runhaskell GoCoWiToTex.hs docs/manual.txt IBEX_VERSION >docs/manual.pdf

This creates docs/manual.pdf. The automatic conversion is still a little
buggy in places, but the resulting PDF is pretty usable.

To do this, you'll need:

    * A standard LaTeX install (with all the usual packages).

    * GHC (Haskell compiler). http://www.haskell.org/ghc
